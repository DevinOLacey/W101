My name is Devin, and I'm an avid W101 raid player who consistently pushes to find new challenging and fun ways to complete raids, as well as optimizing or simplifying them. I am the co-leader of the Spiral Shadows guild that took a top place in the community Spiral Cup and plans to take higher spots in guild-specific competitions that don't favor overly large communities.

If you are interested in joining The Spirals Shadows please add Devin#0585 or uxoas#7879 on discord (entry to the guild is more open but in game guild spots will go to the most active members)
